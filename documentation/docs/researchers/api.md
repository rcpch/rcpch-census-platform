## Using the API for Research/Audit

RCPCH Census Platform is an online data archive for all environmental information relating to child health. It aims to bring into one place data that is already published.

RCPCH Census Platform data is not published as spreadsheets, but instead as [`JSON`](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). This is because the primary function of the Platform is supply information to other applications the RCPCH build and host. For example, this project serves the Epilepsy12 and NPDA audits RCPCH has built.

To interrogate the API, one can either navigate the [browsable API](url), or use the [Open API Specification](url) to view the data. The Open API browser accepts parameters to filter searches.

### Postman

Software developers typically use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to interact with and test APIs. A researcher can use Postman through their web browser or download it onto their computer. There are good tutorials and explainers on APIs and Postman [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/overview/).

### Microsoft Excel

<!-- This bit needs doing: TBH I don't know have to get Excel to talk to a JSON API, and guess that involves writing some visual basic. -->

### Future resource

The primary aim for RCPCH Census Platform is to provide a single source of standardised resources to support the software projects RCPCH produce. A secondary aim, however, is to curate datasets for all interested in child health to use, either in research or audit, or in the development of software whose main goal is improve child health.
