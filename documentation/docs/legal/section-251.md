The Epilepsy12 audit engine has been granted an exemption from Section 251 of the NHS Act 2006 by the Confidentiality Advisory Group (CAG) of the Health Research Authority (HRA). This means that healthcare providers in England no longer need to screen patients against the opt-out list prior to entering their data into Epilepsy12.

We are reviewed annual for compliance with conditions of the exemption, and a selection of the most recent and relevant documents are embedded below. You can see more information on the [Epilepsy12 section of the RCPCH website](https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/work-we-do/clinical-audits/epilepsy12/about)
